# This is an input file for the radio-emission modeling code developed by G. H. Ortiz-Pena
# The file contains the physical parameters of the simulation, such as the star's rotation period,
# inclinaiton angles, average electron energy, etc. 
#
# Format is as follows (separated by commas):
# number of loops, e-distribution
# Period, B_0, beta, i,
# For each loop:
# L-shell, delta, longitude
